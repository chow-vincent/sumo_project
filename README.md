# Sumo Wrestling Machine Learning Project


## Intro
The goal of this project was to use machine learning to **predict the outcomes of sumo wrestling bouts** in Japan Sumo Grand Tournaments.


## Folders

data/  : contains data collected from online, public database using the Beautiful Soup Library. Stored as pickle files from pandas dataframes.

plots/ : contains visualizations of data in Seaborn plots saved as png's.

tourneys/ : contains daily tourney head-to-head lineups for March (Haru) Basho 2017.


## Python Scripts and Modules

Machine Learning Files:

**machine_learning.py** : Script for doing various machine learning tasks, including model evaluation & predicting outcomes of new bouts.

**ml_fxns.py** : Module with helper functions for various machine learning tasks. Could include data pre-processing tasks, prediction tasks, etc.


Data Scraping Files:

**rikishi_scrape.py** : Module with functions used for scraping data with Beautiful Soup. Functions are used when scraping data from multiple html pages/sumo wrestlers.

**scrape_multiple_h2h.py** : Script to scrape head-to-head data for multiple sumo wrestlers.

**scrape_multiple_rikishi.py** : Script to scrape basic profile data for multiple sumo wrestlers.


Data Preparation Files:

**data_extraction.py** : Module with helper functions for processing information extracted from html tags using scraping libraries (e.g. Beautiful Soup). 

**database_ops.py** : Module with helper functions to perform various operations with DataFrames.

**feature_generation.py** : Script to generate DataFrame containing feature data and labels.

**filter_duplicates.py** : Script to filter out the duplicate rows in raw head-to-head DataFrame generated by feature generation script.



## Jupyter Notebooks

**ml_playground.ipynb** : notebook for playing around with various machine learning tasks.

**testing_playground.ipynb** : notebook for testing miscellaneous pieces of code.

**visualizations.ipynb** : notebook for generating Seaborn visualizations of scraped data.
