The ultimate goal of this project was to predict the outcomes of sumo wrestling bouts in Japan Sumo Grand Tournaments. There are few Western attempts at using sports analytics on Eastern sports, and this is an attempt at filling that gap.

First, I built a database by scraping and parsing data from publicly available data at http://sumodb.sumogames.de/. This website contains relevant data for sumo wrestlers dating back to as early as 1600. I scrape basic profile info (e.g. height, weight, rank, stable, country of origin), as well as head-to-head matches (the outcomes between two sumo wrestlers). I have a database of 12,374 unique sumo wrestlers, as well as the outcomes of over 300,000 head-to-head matches dating back to the early 2000's.

Next, I visualized the data to observe interesting trends and look for features to include for machine learning. Plots are generated using Seaborn and saved as png's.

Finally, I trained a logistic regression model from this data to predict the outcomes of new matches during the March (Haru) Basho in 2017. [results pending]
